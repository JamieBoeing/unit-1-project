// My son is super smart, an AP honor student, and a captain on his QuizBowl Team 
and I wanted to write a game dedicated to him


This Game is going to be multiple choice, and have some kind of 
bonus point system for time answered correct. I considered making levels
or making a story line to the game, but I may just keep it simple

//define variables
1. Data [objects] to store answers, and questions

// define questions array
2. random questions function(fetch)
//add more questions 

//Start the game
3. display questions function()

//bonus points if they answer within the alloted time
4. Timer function()bonus points()set timeout

//check answer with a loop 
5. check answers function()
//correct/incorrect messages

/update
6. Update score function()

//end the game when score max reached or question count (not sure yet)
7. Endgame function
